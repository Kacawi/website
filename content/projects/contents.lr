title: Open Source Projects

body:

Because of its prevalence in our modern life, I believe that software has to be open source where possible. I have contributed to open source projects, and have contributed my own as well. Please check them out below.

### Network Analytics Made Simple

Borrowing the theme of [Allen Downey's](http://www.allendowney.com) "X Made Simple" series, I have started my own [Network Analysis Made Simple](http://github.com/ericmjl/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple) series of Jupyter notebooks, freely available for everybody.

### `scikit-learn` Tutorial

I led a tutorial on the `scikit-learn` API at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. The materials are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ericmjl/scikit-learn-tutorial).

### Data Testing Tutorial

In collaboration with [Renee Chu](https://twitter.com/reneighbor), we are developing tutorial material to teach how to write tests. Material are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ericmjl/data-testing-tutorial).

### Hive Plots in Python

[Hive plots](http://hiveplot.net) are a rational way of visualizing networks. I wrote my own Python implementation of `hiveplot`, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ericmjl/hiveplot).

### Circos Plots in Python

[Circos plots](http://circos.ca) are an aesthetically pleasing way of visualizing networks. I wrote my own Python implementation called `Circos`, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ericmjl/Circos).
